# 3-Dimensional
Website for 3d Printing

3-Dimensional was a school project that I created. The theme was based on my love for 3D printing and my desire to make a website of my own without using a website builder like WordPress or Wix. Some of the content within this website was strictly to meet the demanded criteria of the course while others were personal additions. This was one of my first websites that I made and I look back on it as a learning experience.
